# MHD_Solvers_OpenFOAM

This repository contains OpenFOAM solvers and turbulence models suitable for solving various magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows.
The solvers work with OpenFOAM v2006+.
Everyone is welcome to use these solvers. you don't need to ask permissions for that :)
Multiple sourses were used to implement these codes, specifically personal discussions on https://www.cfd-online.com/
