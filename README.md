# MHD_Solvers_OpenFOAM

This repository contains OpenFOAM solvers and turbulence models suitable for solving various magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows.  
These solvers work only for so-called one-way MHD flows (the magnetic Reynolds number Re_m < 1).
The presented solvers and models are compatable with OpenFOAM v2006+.  
Multiple sources were used to implement these codes. Specifically, a lot of useful information was found on https://www.cfd-online.com/

Validation of the solvers has been conducted and published as a [benchmark](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2021.108800):

Everyone is welcome to use these solvers, you don't need to ask permission for that. Please  keep in mind that the code can be "ugly and messy" but it works :D
