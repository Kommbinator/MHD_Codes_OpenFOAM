# MHD_Solvers_OpenFOAM

This repository contains OpenFOAM solvers and turbulence models suitable for solving various magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows.
The solvers work with OpenFOAM v2006+.

Multiple sourses were used to implement these codes. Specifically, a lot of useful information was found on https://www.cfd-online.com/

Everyone is welcome to use these solvers, you don't need to ask permissions for that :)
